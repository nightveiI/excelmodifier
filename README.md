# Dataforma_Converter
PIP Packages below
This project was meant to be used by McAllen Valley Roofing Co. to help data analytics.
Using xlwings, I created the functions and classes that allows a really simple UI to be displayed and allow users
to choose parameters for an exported Dataforma CSV to be transformed into something readable for 
the Production Department, the Founders of the company, and any of the interested parties.
